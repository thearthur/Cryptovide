This is a low-level implementation of JSON.  It supports basic types,
arrays, Collections, and Maps.  You can extend it to handle new types
by adding methods to print-json.

This library does NOT attempt to preserve round-trip equality between
JSON and Clojure data types.  That is, if you write a JSON string with
this library, then read it back with clojure.contrib.json.read, you
won't necessarily get the exact same data structure.

If you want round-trip equality and/or indented output, try Dan
Larkin's clojure-json library at
http://github.com/danlarkin/clojure-json

This implementation attempts to follow the description of JSON at
<http://json.org/>.  Maps become JSON objects, all other collections
become JSON arrays.  JSON object keys are always converted to strings.
Within strings, all non-ASCII characters are hexadecimal escaped.
